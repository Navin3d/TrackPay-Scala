  Hi, everyone.  I’m excited to share how we can leverage AI tools to enhance our development processes with an real-time example,

Duo stands out as a powerful tool for integrating AI-driven capabilities into our day-to-day development, enhancing our efficiency, and reducing manual intervention.

As a quick demonstration, I’ll walk you through a simple example where we use a shell script to analyze logs. 

Let’s say we have a scenario where our application generates logs that contain critical errors, warnings, and informational messages. Our goal is to quickly filter out the insights like no of requets per hour, auerage response time, network performances, load balancing and unique user agents.

The script reads the log file, filters out the error lines, and then categorizes them by type and frequency.

The focus is on AI as a co-pilot, making us faster and more efficient. deliver features faster, fix bugs more efficiently, and maintain high-quality code. AI is here to help us do just that,

I’ve taken a familiar task: analyzing data from our ARE stg_recon_table through a simple Spring Boot application, but with AI-enhanced capabilities.

We’ve all spent countless hours writing similar code structures—defining entities, writing CRUD operations, setting up services, and then creating tests. These are essential, but they’re also time-consuming. 

AI can automate these repetitive tasks, allowing us to focus more on the unique logic and less on boilerplate code.

demo is about using AI to generate the essential components of a Spring Boot application. I’ll show you how, with a few simple prompts, we can automatically create:

Entities: AI generates domain models based on our data structure.
Services: Business logic layers with methods tailored to our specific needs.
Controllers: REST APIs that handle client requests.
Repositories: Data access layers for interacting with the database.
Test Cases: Automatically generated tests to ensure our components work as expected.

=== demo
How AI Generates Code with Prompts:

Generating an Entity:
Prompt: “Create a JPA entity for a transaction with fields: id, amount, date, status.”

Creating the Service Layer:
Prompt: “Generate a service for handling transaction operations including creating, updating, and fetching transactions.”

Building the Controller:
Prompt: “Generate a REST controller for transactions with endpoints for CRUD operations.”

Developing the Repository:
Prompt: “Create a repository interface for the Transaction entity.”

Generating Test Cases:
Prompt: “Generate unit tests for the transaction service, controller, and repository.”

- Instant Productivity Boost
- Consistency and Best Practices
- Focus on Core Logic:
- Test-Driven Development
